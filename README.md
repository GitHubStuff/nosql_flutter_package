# template_flutter_package v3.29.0

To create/use an example application -

```zsh
# .gitmodules has a link to an example app on the repo
# this terminal command will pull and initialize that app
# adding the /example folder (see .gitmodules)
git submodule update --init
```

After the /example folder is created:

-- edit ```.gitmodules``` an remove the entry for submodle example

```zsh
# the entry looks like:
[submodule "example"]
    path = example
    url = https://github.com/GitHubStuff/template_flutter_app
```

This will make the /example folder part of the package's code
